   - Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)
   - Optimize and deploy models for production

2. **Build RAG Systems**
   - Set up vector databases
   - Implement advanced retrieval patterns
   - Evaluate and monitor RAG performance

3. **Create Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Design agent architectures
