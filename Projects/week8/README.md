- Build meta-learning agents

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Long-Term Memory
- Vector database for memory
- Store:
  - User preferences
  - Past interactions
  - Learned patterns
  - Context summaries
- Retrieve relevant memories
- Update memories over time

#### Task 2: Planning Agents
- Implement planning algorithms:
  - Tree of Thoughts
  - ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
  - Chain of Thought
- Break down complex tasks
- Create execution plans
- Monitor plan execution

#### Task 3: Tool Learning
- Agents learn to use tools better
- Track tool usage patterns
- Optimize tool selection
- Create new tools from patterns

#### Task 4: Meta-Learning
- Agents learn from past experiences
- Improve over time
- Adapt to new domains
- Transfer learning

### Deliverables
